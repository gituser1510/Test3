Download and install osra, Symyx Draw and GflAx
( http://download.xnview.com/GflAxSetup.exe )

Place the all files in this folder in your Symyx Draw addins folder.  
Then start Symyx Draw and you should see a new menu item in the File menu 
called "Import Images".  Set the full path to your osra.bat file in the
settings dialog. You can now import images and PDF documents, or copy/paste
an image into the Symyx Draw editor. For the latter functionality
you can either:
- use ClipMagic http://www.clipmagic.com/download.html on Windows
- for PDF files use the Snapshot tool (it has a picture of a camera) in your
version of Adobe Reader. In version 9 it's under Tools/Select and Zoom/Snapshot Tool,
and you can add it to the toolbar under Views/Toolbars/More Tools.
